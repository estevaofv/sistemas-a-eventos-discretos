TCT_20150701 (posted 2015.07.01)

TCT_20150701 updates TCT_20140701, posted 2014.07.01.  It is available in 
two versions: Win32 for 32-bit machines and X64 for 64-bit machines.  While 
they have essentially the same functionality, X64 can handle larger problems.  
User-generated files are usually not interchangeable between the two versions.

TCT runs as a Windows console program, and uses Windows' memory management.

To install:

1.  Make a working folder [path]\TCT for the version required.

2.  Copy in the files TCT[version].exe, TctInfo.pdf, Readme.txt and 
    ScreenSettings.txt, together with the subfolders USER and Graphviz. 

3.  Run TCT[version].exe in Windows.  For summary descriptions of the TCT 
    procedures, press I from the Main Options page.  Details can be found 
    in the monograph "Supervisory Control of Discrete-Event Systems",
    updated 2015.07.01.  

4.  If desired, adjust the screen display by clicking on the button in the 
    upper left corner and resetting the display parameters according to the 
    file ScreenSettings.txt provided in this package.
